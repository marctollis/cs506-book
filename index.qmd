-   Develop an understanding of R and the Tidyverse ecosystem

-   Import structured and unstructured data into R

-   Clean and transform data using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and other core Tidyverse packages

-   Visualize data effectively using `ggplot2`

-   Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)

-   Apply data wrangling techniques to real-world datasets
