## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

-   Install and open R, RStudio, and Quarto
-   Navigate the four-pane layout of RStudio
-   Create and run R scripts
-   Understand the differences between the console, script editor, and environment
-   Execute basic R operations and understand data types
-   Install and load R packages
-   Create and render a Quarto (`.qmd`) document to `.pdf`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Started

R is a programming language designed for data analysis.\
RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes working with R easier.\
Quarto is a tool for creating reproducible documents that combine code and text.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installing R, RStudio, and Quarto

1.  Install R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
2.  Install RStudio: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
3.  Install Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>

When you open RStudio, you’ll see four panes:

-   Console – runs code interactively
-   Source – write and save scripts or Quarto documents
-   Environment/History – view and manage objects
-   Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer – navigation and visualization tools

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction to Quarto

Quarto allows you to create documents that include both text and executable R code.

### Your First Quarto Document

1.  In RStudio: File → New File → Quarto Document
2.  Replace the header with:

``` yaml
---
title: "My First Quarto Document"
author: "Your Name"
format: pdf
---
```

3.  Below the header, add:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(x)
```

4.  Click Render to produce a PDF file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### In-Class Quarto Exercise

-   Create a new Quarto document with:
    -   A title, your name, and the date
    -   A short paragraph of text
    -   A code chunk that calculates the mean and standard deviation of a numeric vector
-   Render it to PDF and verify it works.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basic R Concepts

### Variables and Assignments

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 10
z <- x + y
z
```

### Vectors and Functions

```{r}
ages <- c(25, 30, 35, 40)
mean(ages)
sd(ages)
```

### Data Frames

```{r}
name <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
age <- c(25, 30, 35)
student_data <- data.frame(name, age)
student_data
```

### Inspecting Data

```{r}
str(student_data)
summary(student_data)
head(student_data)
```

### Comments and Help

```{r}
# This is a comment
?mean  # Help for the mean function
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Using Scripts and Console

-   Write your code in the script editor and run lines with Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac)
-   Save scripts with the `.R` extension
-   Use the Console for quick exploration

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Installing and Loading Packages

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### In-Class R Exercises

1.  Create a numeric vector of five numbers and calculate its mean, median, and standard deviation.
2.  Create a data frame with three columns (name, age, and major) and print its structure.
3.  Import a dataset from a URL using `read.csv()` and summarize it using `summary()`.

```{r}
my_vec <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
mean(my_vec)
median(my_vec)
sd(my_vec)

df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Lily", "Mark", "Tom"),
  age = c(21, 22, 23),
  major = c("Biology", "Math", "History")
)
str(df)

data <- read.csv("https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/airtravel.csv")
summary(data)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Homework Preview

-   Create a `.qmd` document that:
    -   Includes a title and your name
    -   Demonstrates at least three code chunks
    -   Shows basic statistics on a numeric vector
    -   Imports a dataset, inspects it with `str()` and `summary()`, and writes one paragraph summarizing your findings
-   Render to PDF and submit to Canvas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps

You now know how to run R scripts and render Quarto documents.\
Next week, you’ll learn how to create data visualizations using `ggplot2`.
