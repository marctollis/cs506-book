## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

-   Import CSV and TSV files with `readr`
-   Understand column types
-   Diagnose and fix import problems

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reading CSV and TSV Files

The `readr` package (part of the tidyverse) provides fast and friendly functions for reading text data.

### Example: Reading a CSV file

Using `read_csv()`, give the path of the file. For instance, you download a file to your `data` folder.

```{r eval=FALSE}
### students <- read_csv("data/students.csv")
```

Here, we will just use the url:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

students <- read_csv("https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv")
students
```

**Practical Advice:** Look at your data so you can transform it. See the "N/A"s?

```{r}
students <- read_csv("https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv", na = c("N/A", ""))
students
```

Type `students` at your R prompt. Notice that `Student ID` and `Full Name` have backticks.

```{r}
students |> 
  rename(
    student_id = `Student ID`,
    full_name = `Full Name`
  )
```

### Other arguments

```{r}
read_csv(
  "a,b,c
  1,2,3
  4,5,6"
)
```

You can read a CSV and skip the first few lines if they contain metadata.

```{r}
read_csv(
  "The first line of metadata
  The second line of metadata
  x,y,z
  1,2,3",
  skip = 2
)
```

If there are no column names:

```{r}
read_csv(
  "1,2,3
  4,5,6",
  col_names = FALSE
)
```

Or, add column names:

```{r}
read_csv(
  "1,2,3
  4,5,6",
  col_names = c("x", "y", "z")
)
```

### Also: Reading a TSV file

```{r, eval=FALSE}
### df_tsv <- read_tsv("data/example.tsv")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### In-Class Exercise 1 – CSV

1.  Download the `students` data (e.g., from the course repository).\
2.  Read it into R using `read_csv()`.\
3.  Inspect its structure with `glimpse()`.\
4.  What data types were automatically detected?\
5.  Notice the tick marks around some column names.\
6.  Use `janitor::clean_names()` to turn all column names to snake case.

### In-Class Challenge

Change the data type stored in the `meal_plan` column. Hint: you can use `factor()` with `mutate()`.

## Column Types and Parsing

`readr` automatically guesses column types, but you can override them.

```{r}
read_csv("
  logical,numeric,date,string
  TRUE,1,2021-01-15,abc
  false,4.5,2021-02-15,def
  T,Inf,2021-02-16,ghi
")
```

### But what if the data is not clean?

```{r}
simple_csv <- "
  x
  10
  .
  20
  30"
```

Read it with `read_csv()` - see that it's a character column?

```{r}
read_csv(simple_csv)

```

There is some missing data. So `readr` turns what should be a double or numeric column into a character column.

Tell `readr` that it is a numeric column with `col_types`.

The `col_types` function takes a named list where the names match the column names in the CSV file.

```{r}
df <- read_csv(
  simple_csv, 
  col_types = list(x = col_double())
)
```

Read the warning. Use `problems` to find out what that's about:

```{r}
problems(df)
```

We can make `.` indicate missing data using `na = "."`:

```{r}
read_csv(simple_csv, na = ".")
```

Other column type functions in `readr` are `col_logical()`, `col_integer()`, `col_character()`, `col_factor()`, `col_date()`, `col_datetime`, and `col_number()`.

You can parse numbers with `parse_number()`, dates with `parse_date()`, and times with `parse_time()`.

### In-Class Exercise 2

1.  Load a simple CSV file with `simple_csv()`.\
2.  Use `col_types()` to change a data type of a column.\
3.  Use `problems()` to diagnose a warning.\
4.  Use `na =` to properly code missing data.\

### In-Class Challenge

1.  Read a TSV file from PanTHERIA: "https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/184/PanTHERIA_1-0_WR93_Aug2008.txt"\
2.  Use `na =` to change all `999.00`s to missing data.\

## Writing to a file

You can use `write_csv()` or `write_tsv()`.

```{r}
write_csv(students, "students.csv")
```

### In-Class Exercise 3

1.  Write a CSV (i.e. `students`) to a file `students-2.csv`\
2.  Read that file in again with `read_csv`.\

## Homework Preview

For homework, you will:

-   Import at least **one CSV** and **one Excel** dataset
-   Fix any parsing issues (e.g., column types, dates)
-   Clean at least one column with `mutate()`
-   Provide a short summary (using `group_by()` and `summarize()`)
-   Render to PDF and submit

## Next Steps

Next week, we will learn to **work with text data and regular expressions** using the `stringr` package.
