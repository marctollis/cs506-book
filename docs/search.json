The instructor will generally not respond to emails on weekends or after working hours (i.e., in the evenings), so please plan accordingly.\nCheating, including plagiarism of writing or computer code, will not be tolerated. All academic integrity violations are treated seriously. Academic integrity violations will result in penalties including, but not limited to, a zero on the assignment, a failing grade in the class, or expulsion from NAU. The University’s Academic Integrity policies will be strictly enforced. |\nEach student is required to demonstrate respect towards their peers and the instructor. The instructor is held to the same standard. - The instructor will not provide copies of course notes. These materials should be sought from the students’ peers or by watching the recorded lectures.\nElectronic device usage must support learning in the class. All cell phones, PDAs, music players and other entertainment devices must be turned off (or put on silent) during lecture.\nGrades will be entered in Canvas and . Please check LOUIE for your final grade.\nAttendance: Active participation in coding activities is expected. Repeated, unexcused absences may affect the student’s grade.\nCollaboration: Allowed for homeworks; problem sets and quizzes must be completed individually. - Late Work: Accepted only with prior arrangement.\nAcademic Integrity: Students must adhere to NAU’s academic integrity policy.",
