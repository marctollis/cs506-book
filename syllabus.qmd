# Course Overview

**INF506: Data Wrangling and** **Management** introduces graduate students to data wrangling and management using **R** and the **Tidyverse** ecosystem. Students will learn to import, manipulate, clean, and visualize data with a strong emphasis on practical applications and reproducible workflows.

## Canvas & Recorded Lectures

We will use the learning management system, Canvas, to conduct some course business, including assignment disbursement and submitting. I will use Canvas to record lectures for future viewing.

## CS506 Book Website

I have compiled a [course website](https://marctollis.github.io/cs506-book/) that has supplemental text and coded examples that we will walk through in class. This website essentially serves as the course textbook and is required reading. There will be other required reading material.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

-   Use R and RStudio for data analysis
-   Import structured and unstructured data
-   Clean and transform data using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and other Tidyverse packages
-   Create effective visualizations using `ggplot2`
-   Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-   Apply data wrangling techniques to real datasets

## Course Student Learning Outcomes

**LO1.** Compare and contrast major classes of and techniques for data handling (synthesis).\

Students will be able to:\
1. Identify various sources of data\
2. Identify and utilize tool chains appropriate for accessing data\

**LO2.** Design and enact data manipulation, analysis, and visualization workflows for large, heterogenous datasets (application).

Students will be able to:\
1. Aggregate data from multiple sources\
2. Reshape data for further analysis\
3. Validate data\
4. Generate meaningful statistics summarizing the data\
5. Visualize trends in data\

**LO3.** Reason about advantages, preferred use cases, and weaknesses of various data manipulation techniques (application)

**LO4.** Develop a conceptual understanding of how the field of data management is evolving (knowledge).\

Students will be able to:\
1. Find and employ data management tools in **R**\
2. Find and employ data visualization tools in **R**

## Program Student Outcomes supported by this class

This course directly supports the following program student outcomes in the Masters of Science in Computational and Applied Data Science program assessment and improvement plan:

**SO2.** Build the practical skills to explore, analyze, manage, and visualize large data sets using the latest technologies.

**SO3.** Evaluate and use well accepted methods to obtain, clean, pre-process, and transform data for further processing.

**SO4.** Apply data science and cutting-edge analytical methods to address data-rich problems from a variety of fields, think critically about data, and drive decision making.

**SO7.** Identify, appraise, and investigate ethical issues surrounding data collection, use, and data-driven decision making and to act in an informed and conscientious ethical manner.

# Required Materials

-   **Textbook:** [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (free online)
-   **Software:**
    -   [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
    -   [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assessments

| Component                         | Weight |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
| Problem Sets (8 total)            | 22.5%  |
| Homeworks (6 total)               | 22.5%  |
| Quizzes (6 total, lowest dropped) | 50%    |
| Attendance                        | 5%     |

-   Grades will be assigned using the weighted sum described above using this scale: **A** ≥ 90%, **B** ≥ 80%, **C** ≥ 70%, **D** ≥ 60%, **F** \< 60%.

-   **Problem sets** and **homeworks** are marked as **complete** or **incomplete**.

-  **Problem sets** are simpler assignments and will be completed on your own, while **homeworks** can be done in groups.

# Policies

## Course Policies

-   Students are encouraged to attend the office hours of the instructor. If a student cannot attend regular office hours with the instructor, an appointment may be considered if made via email with sufficient advanced notice.

-   Emails addressed to the instructor must be **respectful and professional**. The instructor will respond to emails promptly, within 2 business days. The instructor will generally not respond to emails on weekends or after working hours (i.e., in the evenings), so please plan accordingly.

-   Cheating, including plagiarism of writing or computer code, will not be tolerated. All academic integrity violations are treated seriously.

The University's Academic Integrity policies will be strictly enforced. \|

-   Each student is required to demonstrate respect towards their peers and the instructor. The instructor is held to the same standard. - The instructor will not provide copies of course notes. These materials should be sought from the students’ peers or by watching the recorded lectures.

-   Electronic device usage must support learning in the class. All cell phones, PDAs, music players and other entertainment devices must be turned off (or put on silent) during lecture.

-   Grades will be entered in Canvas and . Please check LOUIE for your final grade.

-   **Attendance:** Active participation in coding activities is expected. Repeated, unexcused absences may affect the student's grade.

-   **Collaboration:** Allowed for **homeworks**; **problem sets** and **quizzes** must be completed individually. - **Late Work:** Accepted only with prior arrangement.

-   **Academic Integrity:** Students must adhere to NAU’s academic integrity policy.\
