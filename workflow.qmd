title: "Workflow and Reproducibility"
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Organize your work with R projects
- Use Quarto for reproducible documents
- Follow best practices for naming files and structuring directories
- Incorporate code, text, and output into a single reproducible report
- Use version control with GitHub (optional, for advanced students)

---

# 1. Why Workflow Matters

Reproducible workflows:

- Make it easy to rerun analyses later
- Allow others to reproduce your results
- Keep projects organized and easy to navigate
- Prevent errors caused by hard-coded file paths and messy code

---

# 2. Organizing Projects in RStudio

### RStudio Projects

- Use **File → New Project** for each analysis/course project
- Keep data, scripts, and outputs in **subfolders** (e.g., `data/`, `scripts/`, `figures/`, `docs/`)
- Avoid using absolute paths—use **relative paths** inside the project

---

### Example Project Structure

```
my_project/
  data/
    raw_data.csv
  scripts/
    analysis.R
  figures/
    plot1.png
  docs/
    report.qmd
  my_project.Rproj
```

---

## In-Class Exercise 1 – Project Setup

1. Create a new RStudio Project for this course.  
2. Make folders: `data`, `scripts`, `outputs`.  
3. Save your `.qmd` homework file in the project root.  
4. Render your Quarto document and confirm outputs stay organized.

---

# 3. Quarto for Reproducibility

Quarto allows you to:

- Combine text and code in one document
- Render reports to PDF, HTML, or Word
- Ensure results match the code that generated them

### Example Quarto Workflow

```yaml
---
title: "My Analysis"
format: pdf
---
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("data/mydata.csv")
summary(data)
```

---

## In-Class Exercise 2 – Quarto Report

1. Create a `.qmd` file that loads a dataset and runs a simple analysis.  
2. Add at least one plot and one table.  
3. Render to PDF and check the output.

---

# 4. Best Practices for Reproducibility

- **Use scripts and Quarto documents instead of manual steps**
- **Keep raw data unchanged**; clean data with scripts
- **Document everything**: use comments and text
- **Save figures and tables** programmatically, not manually
- **Render final reports from source code**

---

# 5. Optional: Version Control with Git and GitHub

For students interested in collaboration and tracking changes:

- Install Git and create a GitHub account
- Use `usethis::use_git()` to initialize Git in a project
- Commit changes regularly and push to GitHub

(We will not cover Git in detail, but this is recommended for your own practice.)

---

## In-Class Challenge – Reproducible Mini-Report

- Set up a project with an organized folder structure
- Create a Quarto document that:
  - Reads a dataset
  - Runs a simple transformation
  - Creates a plot
  - Summarizes the results in text
- Render to PDF and check for a clean, reproducible output

---

# Homework Preview

For Homework 5, you will:

- Organize your project folder (data, scripts, outputs)
- Create a Quarto report with:
  - One dataset
  - At least one data cleaning step
  - One visualization
  - One table of summary statistics
- Ensure all file paths are relative (not absolute)
- Render to PDF and submit on Canvas

---

# Next Steps

Next week, we will move into **Data Import** (CSV, Excel, and parsing dates) and continue to build your data wrangling workflow.
